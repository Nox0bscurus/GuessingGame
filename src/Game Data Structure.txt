Initial Setup: Consider this starting tree:

// Here the tree has three (3) TreeNodes:
//  Root or "Is it alive?"   (a question node)
//  "Cat", a Yes leaf node
//  "Rock", a No leaf node
Root: "Is it alive?"
  Yes → "Cat" (leaf)
  No → "Rock" (leaf)


Exercise 1.1: Trace through finding "Cat" Fill in what happens at each step:

// Here, the user is thinking of a "Cat"
Step 1: Current node = "Is it alive?" (question)
        Computer asks: "Is it alive?"
        User answers: [Yes/No? Fill in: Yes]
        Next node = [Which child? Fill in: Cat]

Step 2: Current node = [Fill in: Cat] (leaf)
        Computer asks: [Fill in: Is the cat a living thing?]
        User answers: Yes
        Result: [Success/Failure? Fill in: Success, yay!]
        
Tree after this round: [Changed/Unchanged? Fill in: Unchanged.]


Exercise 1.2: Trace through learning "Dog"
Fill in what happens at each step:

// Here, the user is thinking of a "Dog"
Step 1: Current node = "Is it alive?" (question)
        Computer asks: "Is it alive?"
        User answers: Yes
        Next node = [Fill in: Cat..]

Step 2: Current node = "Cat" (leaf)
        Computer asks: "Is the object a Cat?"
        User answers: [Fill in: No.]
        Result: Computer guessed wrong!

Step 3: Learning phase
        Computer asks: "What were you thinking of?"
        User answers: [Fill in: The dog...]
        
        Computer asks: "Please give me a yes/no question to distinguish a Dog from a Cat"
        User answers: [Fill in example question: Are dogs louder than cats?]
        
        Computer asks: "For a Dog, what is the answer to: [your question]?"
        User answers: [Fill in: yes...]


Exercise 1.3: Show the tree structure after learning "Dog"
Complete the transformed tree structure:

// After adding "Dog" to the tree
Root: "Is it alive?"
    Yes → [Fill in: Is the pooch hungry?]
        Yes → [Fill in: *dog barks loudly*]
        No → [Fill in: Cat ]
    No → "Rock" (unchanged)



Exercise 1.4: Trace finding "Dog" in the new tree structure.
Fill in the complete path to find "Dog":

// Here the user is thinking of Dog and uses the updated, transformed tree structure
// Starting from the root
Question 1: Computer asks: [Fill in: Is it alive?]
           User answers: [Fill in: Yes...]
           
Question 2: Computer asks: [Fill in: Is he hungry?]
           User answers: [Fill in: Yes.]
           
Final: Computer asks: [Fill in: Maybe you should feed your dog then...]
       User answers: Yes (Success!)
       
Total questions before guess: [Fill in: 2]
